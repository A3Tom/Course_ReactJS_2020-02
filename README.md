# React Js course / tutorial numero dos

## Goal: 
Honestly I just am kinda gettin into the crazy abstract nonsense that is JSX and the React framework. So my goal is just to have more fun following along with this tutorial to use in a 4 hour build project I've been kickin about my head for the past day

## Expectations: 
By the end of this I fully expect to be able to start a project from nowt and take it to something that is recognizable and usable. I don't think I'll have a problem doing that given that I've had an absolutely solid primer from the big man over at Traversy Media with his course yesterday and also given how ridiculously fluent the API is for React
